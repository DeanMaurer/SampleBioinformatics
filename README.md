This application is a website that demos some simple DNA decoding.
The main purpose behind it is to showcase a full CI loop using GitHub, 
Azure, and AppVeyor to manage an automated build, unit test suite, deploy, 
and integration test suite.

The Azure VM the site was hosted no longer exists, but the CI history
can be found on AppVeyor:
